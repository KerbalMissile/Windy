Windy is a Wind mod for Kerbal Space Program meant to enhance the game by adding wind and other effects!

---

**Curent Features:**

- Wind Speed and Direction
- Forecasts For Speed & Directions
- Python Window for External Display
- Wind Shear
- 3D Wind Direction View
- Gusts
- Thermal Based Wind
- Biome-based wind
- Coriolis effect
- Oceanic Drift
- Saved Wind (Wind saves every quicksave or leave so that when you go back to your save or reload the game it will remember wind speed and direction)
- Extra lift in Headwinds
- Terrain affected wind

**Future Features:**
- Jet Streams
- Volumetric Clouds Integration

---

If you want to use the window make sure you set the file directory at the top to your ksp root folder, then after running the game once, there should be a file called WindyData.txt, set your file location in the Python window to THAT.

---

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.13+ if you plan on using the window
- ModuleManager

**Compatibilites:**
- Outer Planets Mod
- Sketchy support with JNSQ / MRKI, may not work as expected but wind is still there, just not tweaked properly. Just the stock planets though, not the additions.

**Incompatibilities:**
- Any Planet Pack Currently (Planet revamps are fine)
- Advanced Atmosphere Tools
- Kerbal Weather Project
- Ferram Aerospace Research Continued (Might work but I don't suggest it)
